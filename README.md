# Transformers from Scratch

This project involves building a Transformer model from scratch in Python, including key components such as Multi-Head Attention, Feed Forward Networks, and other foundational elements. The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how Transformers work by implementing them manually, rather than relying on pre-built libraries.

## Features

- **Multi-Head Attention**: Implemented from the ground up, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
- **Feed Forward Network**: Built to process the outputs of the attention mechanism and add non-linearity to the model.
- **Layer Normalization**: Applied to stabilize and accelerate the training process.
- **Positional Encoding**: Added to inject sequence order information into the model, as Transformers are inherently order-agnostic.
- **End-to-End Transformer Model**: Combined the individual components to create a fully functional Transformer model, capable of handling tasks such as sequence modeling and translation.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdarshSingh001/Transformers-Is-All-You-Need.git
    cd transformers-from-scratch
    ```

2. **Set up the environment:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```



## Usage

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format, which allows you to follow along with the code and understand each component of the Transformer model.

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook transformers.ipynb
    ```

2. **Run the notebook:**
   Follow the steps in the notebook to understand the implementation of each component, from Multi-Head Attention to the complete Transformer model.

3. **Experiment:**
   Modify the components or try different tasks (e.g., language translation, text classification) to see how the Transformer performs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the internal workings of Transformer models by implementing them manually.
- Gain hands-on experience with key components like Multi-Head Attention, Feed Forward Networks, and Positional Encoding.
- Develop a strong foundational knowledge that can be applied to more advanced models and real-world tasks.
